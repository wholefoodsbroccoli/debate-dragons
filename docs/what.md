# What's in a Debate?
Parliamentary debate is a **team game** where speakers take turns **giving speeches** in order to **persuade a judge** on a **motion topic.**[^1] This section is meant to guide readers through a debate round, from start to finish.

## Before the Debate
Debates happen between teams of two or three. 

## Topic Selection

### The Motion
Each motion in the debate has a **keyword.** It informs the teams of the specific topic, and which arguments they're allowed to make according to the rules.

This House Would
  -In "This House Would ban all drugs," Government
This House Prefers X to Y
This House Believes That 

### The Veto
Some debate formats let teams pick the motion they want to debate. During topic selection, a list of three motions will be displayed, and each team has to pick a motion to veto, and a motion they prefer. If it's a tie (where both teams veto the same motion, but have different preferences), they flip a coin to decide which motion to do.

## Prep Time
Each team has either 15 or 30 minutes to prepare, depending on the format. They have private time to talk about the debate motion. Typically, the Government team stays in the debate room, while the Opposition team prepares outside.

## Giving Speeches
Each team takes turns sending members to give a speech of up to 7 minutes of uninterrupted speaking time. The Government team goes first, and they argue in favor of the motion. The Opposition argues against. It zigzags back and forth like this helpful diagram.

Opposing speakers are allowed to offer a Point of Information to a speaker on stage. They could stand up, raise their hand, or give a verbal cue, and if the speaker chooses to accept, they're allowed to ask a question or give a comment up to 15 seconds long.

They're long and probably shouldn't be read cover-to-cover, but provide insight into the framework and philosophy behind debating. It makes more sense after firsthand experience!
