# What's in a Debate?
Parliamentary debate is a **team game** where speakers take turns **giving speeches** in order to **persuade a judge** on a **motion topic.**

This section guides readers through a debate, from start to finish. Rather than a comprehensive list of the rules,[^1] it is meant to give a broad vibe or feel for a real round instead.

## Before the Debate
There are two 'benches' in a debate: the Government side, who is supporting the debate 'motion' topic - and the Opposition side, who is against it.

Debates happen between teams of two or three people. Each team knows which bench they are on (Gov or Opp) before the round starts, but they don't know the topic. Each team also knows which person on their team speaks first, second, or last. Each has a different duty, kind of like a role, or position, or character class in a sport or video game.

In a real tournament, debaters don't get to choose their bench, nor do they get to choose the motion they compete on. This ensures each round is unique, and forces speakers to improvise, be creative, and rely on their own knowledge and teamwork to win.

The debaters will be given some time to prepare, and when they're finished, a judge will come to the debate room to decide who the winner is. There are no ties in any debate format, meaning every round has a decisive result.

## The Round Begins!

### The Motion
Each motion in the debate has a **keyword.** The keyword shows teams what they have to do to win the debate, and which arguments they're allowed to make according to the rules. 

For example, in the motion "**This House Prefers** apples to oranges," Government must defend apples and Opposition must defend oranges. This means Gov can't win the debate by proving pears are better than oranges, and Opp can't win the debate by proving oranges are better than nothing. To win, the teams must prove that apples specifically beat oranges, or vice versa.

When debaters first see the motion, they read it very carefully. The motion keyword tells you exactly what it wants your team to do in the debate! Whenever you get stuck, or don't know what arguments to make, or feel lost, oftentimes double-checking the motion is the solution.

### The Veto
Some debate formats let teams pick the motion they want to debate. During topic selection, the teams meet up, and a list of three motions will be displayed. Each team has to pick a motion to veto, and a motion they prefer. If teams have opposite preferences, they flip a coin.

### Prep Time
After the teams and their sides are confirmed, the motion topic is released, and prep time begins. Each team gets 15 to 30 minutes of private time to talk and ready their case. The Government team typically stays within the debate room to plan, while the Opposition team prepares outside.

Debaters are not allowed to use the internet or AI. In physical tournaments, speakers generally must take notes on paper.

## Giving Speeches
When prep time concludes, the debaters go back to the debate room, where the judge does roll call and begins the debate.

Each team sends members one-by-one to give a speech up to 7 minutes long. The Government team begins, and the Opposition goes next, zig-zagging according to the diagram below. The debate ends when the last speaker concludes.

Sometimes debaters give Points of Information to the other team's speaker on stage. They could stand up, raise their hand, or give a verbal cue, and if the speaker chooses to accept, they're allowed to ask a question or give a comment up to 15 seconds long.

## The Judge
The judge decides who wins the debate. 

## After the Debate
The teams shake hands, and can stay to ask the judges for personal feedback and questions about the round. The judge will give a few tips for how to improve next time, and then everybody leaves the debate room!

They're long and probably shouldn't be read cover-to-cover, but provide insight into the framework and philosophy behind debating. It makes more sense after firsthand experience!
