# What's in a Debate?
Parliamentary debate is a **team game** where speakers take turns **giving speeches** in order to **persuade a judge** on a **motion topic.**[^1] This section is meant to guide readers through a debate round, from start to finish.

# Team Game
Friends don't let friends debate alone!

# The Judge

[^1]: The most recent official rules for the [British Parliamentary](https://sadcdebate.com/files/WUDC-Manual-2024.pdf) and [Asian Parliamentary](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JoJa0oqDfW06vAQb3eBcAX37oG9p2g0hRO44vvCHv_Q/edit?tab=t.0) debate formats are here. They're long and probably shouldn't be read cover-to-cover, but provide insight into the framework and philosophy behind debating. It makes more sense after firsthand experience!
