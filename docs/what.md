# What's in a Debate?
Parliamentary debate is a **team game** where speakers take turns **giving speeches** in order to **persuade a judge** on a **motion topic.**[^1] This section is meant to guide readers through a debate round, from start to finish.

## Before the Debate
Debates happen between teams of two or three. 

There are no ties in any debate format, meaning every round has a decisive result.

## Topic Selection

### The Motion
Each motion in the debate has a **keyword.** It informs the teams of the specific topic, and which arguments they're allowed to make according to the rules. 

**This House Would** is a policy motion. The Government team can invent a policy
  -In "This House Would ban all drugs," Opposition is allowed to say, "we won't ban drugs, we will regulate them instead." This is because the two are mutually exclusive, and use a similar amount of resources.
  -In "This House Would grant dictators amnesty for willingly stepping down from office"
This House Believes That 
  -Government believes the statement is true. Opposition believes the statement is false.



### The Veto
Some debate formats let teams pick the motion they want to debate. During topic selection, a list of three motions will be displayed, and each team has to pick a motion to veto, and a motion they prefer. If it's a tie (where both teams veto the same motion, but have different preferences), they flip a coin to decide which motion to do.

## Prep Time
Each team has either 15 or 30 minutes to prepare, depending on the format. They have private time to talk about the debate motion. Typically, the Government team stays in the debate room, while the Opposition team prepares outside.

Debaters are never allowed to use the internet or AI to help them prepare. In physical tournaments, even paper notes are generally required for this reason. 

What does the judge do during prep time? They're probably walking off somewhere.

## Giving Speeches
Each team takes turns sending members to give a speech of up to 7 minutes of uninterrupted speaking time. The Government team goes first, and they argue in favor of the motion. The Opposition argues against. It zigzags back and forth like this helpful diagram.

Opposing speakers are allowed to offer a Point of Information to a speaker on stage. They could stand up, raise their hand, or give a verbal cue, and if the speaker chooses to accept, they're allowed to ask a question or give a comment up to 15 seconds long.

## The Judge
The judge's primary job is to decide who wins. 

## After the Debate
The teams shake hands, and can stay to ask the judges for personal feedback and questions about the round. The judge will give a few tips for how to improve next time, and then everybody leaves the debate room!

## AP vs. BP
Asian Parliamentary is a team vs. team match. British Parliamentary is a battle royale.

They're long and probably shouldn't be read cover-to-cover, but provide insight into the framework and philosophy behind debating. It makes more sense after firsthand experience!
