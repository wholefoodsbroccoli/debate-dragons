# What's in a Debate?
Parliamentary debate is a **team game** where speakers take turns **giving speeches** in order to **persuade a judge** on a **motion topic.**

This section guides readers through a debate, from start to finish. Rather than a comprehensive list of the rules, it is meant to give a broad vibe or feel for a real round instead.

## Before the Debate
There are two 'benches' in a debate: the Government side, who is supporting the debate 'motion' - and the Opposition side, who is against it. Each team knows which bench they are on (Gov or Opp) before the round starts, but they don't know the topic.

Debates happen between teams of two or three people who go first, second, or third. Each has a different duty, like a role, position, or character class in a sport or video game. 

In a real tournament, debaters don't get to choose their bench, nor do they get to choose the motion they compete on. This forces speakers to improvise, be creative, and rely on their own knowledge and teamwork to win.

The debaters will be given some time to prepare, and when they're finished, go to the debate room to begin the round. There are no ties in any debate format, meaning every round has a decisive result.

## The Round Begins!

### The Motion
Each motion in the debate has a **keyword.** The keyword shows what teams must prove to win, and which arguments are allowed by the rules.

For example, in the motion "**This House Prefers** apples to oranges," Government must defend apples and Opposition must defend oranges. This means Gov can't win the debate by proving pears are better than oranges, and Opp can't win the debate by proving oranges are better than nothing. To win, the teams must prove that apples specifically beat oranges, or vice versa.

When debaters first see the motion, they read it very carefully. The motion keyword tells you exactly what it wants your team to do in the debate! Whenever you get stuck, or don't know what arguments to make, or feel lost, oftentimes double-checking the motion is the solution.

### The Veto
Some debate formats let teams pick the motion they want to debate. During topic selection, the teams meet up, and a list of three motions will be displayed. Each team has to pick a motion to veto, and a motion they prefer. If teams have opposite preferences, they flip a coin.

### Prep Time
After the teams and their sides are confirmed, the motion topic is released, and prep time begins. Each team gets 15 to 30 minutes of private time to strategize and ready their case. The Government team typically stays within the debate room to plan, while the Opposition team prepares outside.

How do teams actually use this time?
<li>A few minutes of silent time to come up with original ideas</li>
<li>Anticipating what the opponent will say, and how to respond to it</li>
<li>Fleshing out the case with reasons their arguments are **true** and **important**</li>
<li>Adding details like storytelling, real-world examples, and humor to stick out to the judge</li>
<li>'Setting up' the debate with definitions, helpful details about the world, and why they solve a big problem.</li>

Debaters are not allowed to use the internet or AI to prepare. That would spoil the fun! And may not be as helpful as it sounds. Because of this, speakers generally must take notes on paper in real-life tournaments.

## Giving Speeches
When prep time concludes, the debaters go back to the debate room, where the judge does roll call and begins the debate.

Each team sends members one-by-one to give a speech up to 7 minutes long. The Government team begins, and the Opposition goes next, zig-zagging according to the diagram below. The debate ends when the last speaker concludes.

Normally debaters can't talk during opposing speeches, except for Points of Information to the speaker on stage. A sitting debater could stand up, raise their hand, or give a verbal cue, and if the person on stage chooses to accept, they're allowed up to 15 seconds to comment or ask a question.

As their turn to speak approaches, debaters scramble to write what they're going to say, while simultaneously taking notes on their opponents and trying to counter their speech on the fly. It's not unusual to see debaters cracking jokes, getting sassy, cheering during speeches, pacing around the podium and generally freaking out in the best possible ways!

## The Judge
After the debate, the judge takes time to deliberate. This is when they decide the verdict and prepare their 'oral adjudication,' where they explain the reason for their decision to the debaters afterwards. Sometimes there are 'panels' of multiple judges, led by a 'chair,' the chief judge who coordinates them. 

The judges will go through their notes, sort through the 'clashes,' or main issues in the debate, and then discuss which side won the more important clashes. Generally, teams who make sure their arguments are **more likely** and **more important** than the other side have a higher chance of winning.

Judging can be tricky, because they have to condense an hour's worth of speeches into a 10 minute OA. It ideally has to be easy to understand, defensible to suspicious debaters, and ready in time for the next round to start! This is why many chairs are also experienced debaters who are familiar with the format.

### How Judging Works ###   

Great observation! In order for debate to be as fair and unbiased as possible, judges have to follow two golden principles:  

1) **Noninterventionism** - Judges avoid 'inserting themselves' into the debate, which means they can't use their own opinions, or information that didn't come from the debate. Everything used to decide the verdict must come within the round itself. Only during incredibly messy debates - ones where there isn't enough information within the round to determine a clear winner (like when the teams have two completely different, equally convincing views of reality), will a judge be forced to intervene.  

2) **The Average Reasonable Voter** - Instead, judges adopt the perspective of a person who: knows basic facts and news headlines, understands logic and logical fallacies, isn't biased towards any culture or geographical location, and can be convinced of anything given a good explanation.  

The voter lacks 'specialized knowledge', so debaters have to make sure they explain complex ideas to them step-by-step, even if they're the smartest person in the world. This means numerical statistics and real-world studies can't be taken at face value in parliamentary debate (we can't fact-check or just take your word on it!) - they have to be explained in a way that a person can intuitively understand.  

Savvy readers may ask further questions. 'Wait, does that mean you can completely make things up, as long as it makes sense to the judge?' 'Where do you draw the line between specialized and basic knowledge?' Very astute! Too much intervention can squash creative ideas and force teams to work unfairly hard to overcome judge biases. Too little means rewarding lies, stock arguments, and debate lingo at the expense of real-world knowledge - which is what the game is supposed to encourage in the first place. The question of how much to intervene is an active debate within the community - and you'll likely find as many different answers as there are judges.  

For those interested in becoming judges, you'll find it can be a uniquely collaborative experience in a competitive game. It's heartwarming to encourage debaters and help them improve, while working together with fellow panelists to reach a common goal. It's also easy to learn debate through observation and hearing the thoughts of experienced judges and speakers. Batey believes that every aspiring debater should try out judging - if not for the camaraderie, because understanding how to think like a judge is crucial to winning rounds.

## After the Debate
The teams shake hands, and can stay to ask the judges for personal feedback and questions about the round. The judge will give a few tips for how to improve next time, and then everybody leaves the debate room! 

In a tournament, the judges would fill out a 'ballot' that tells the result of the debate, and gives each person a speaker score. The debaters would fill out a feedback form for the judges, and give them a score as well.

People expect a lot from their judges, so remember to be kind to them, especially if they're new! It helps to ask targeted questions instead of expecting the judge to have ready-made personal feedback all the time. That said, many judges you'll find in tournaments, as well as the debaters in our club love debate and are happy to nerd out about it! Please take advantage of the free individual feedback our club provides - that's more than a lot of teachers give!

## Bonus: Asian Parliamentary and British Parliamentary
The two main formats we do in our club. [^1]

Asian Parliamentary involves two teams with three people each. Prep time is longer (30 minutes), and vetos are allowed. The winning team gets 1 point, the losing team gets 0.

British Parliamentary involves four teams with two partners each. Prep time is shorter (15 minutes) and there are no vetos. Teams are ranked 1st to 4th, and every team wants to out-compete each other, regardless of their bench.

If Asian Parliamentary is a team deathmatch, British Parliamentary is a battle royale. AP tends to be more forgiving and easy for new debaters, while BP is a free-for-all brawl.

[^1]: The most recent official rules for the [British Parliamentary](https://sadcdebate.com/files/WUDC-Manual-2024.pdf) and [Asian Parliamentary](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JoJa0oqDfW06vAQb3eBcAX37oG9p2g0hRO44vvCHv_Q/edit?tab=t.0) debate formats are here. They're long and probably shouldn't be read cover-to-cover, but provide insight into the framework and philosophy behind debating. It makes more sense after firsthand experience!
