# What's in a Debate?
This section describes exactly what a debate is like, from start to finish.

# The Rules [^1]
Parliamentary debate is a team game where Some debate formats give you the topic ahead of time, and you research for months. Not for us! Everything is improvised, and you only get the debate motion 15-30 minutes in advance.

[^1]: The most recent official rules for the [British Parliamentary](https://sadcdebate.com/files/WUDC-Manual-2024.pdf) and [Asian Parliamentary](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JoJa0oqDfW06vAQb3eBcAX37oG9p2g0hRO44vvCHv_Q/edit?tab=t.0) debate formats are here. They're long and probably shouldn't be read cover-to-cover, but provide insights into the framework and philosophy behind debating. It makes more sense after firsthand experience!
