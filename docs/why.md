<li>Want to make new friends</li>
<li>Love learning new things about the world</li>
<li>Enjoy listening to video essays, and other interesting ideas</li>
<li>Have a competitive streak!</li>
<li>Want to feel seen or heard</li>
<li>Crave self improvement / the grind</li>
<li>Want to (sometimes) fly abroad to tournaments for free!!!</li>
