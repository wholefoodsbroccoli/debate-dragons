# Why Debate?
This section is meant for people who are on the fence about debate, or are thinking about joining but have concerns. We aim to address those concerns directly here.

That said, Batey loves debate, and wants to show how much fun it can be too! It is an incredibly rewarding activity, in that debate gives back the effort you choose to share with it. Consider trying debate if you:

<li>Want to make new friends</li>
<li>Love learning new things about the world</li>
<li>Enjoy listening to video essays, comedy, and interesting ideas</li>
<li>Have a competitive streak!</li>
<li>Want to feel seen or heard</li>
<li>Crave self improvement / the grind</li>
<li>Want to (sometimes) fly abroad to tournaments for free!!!</li>

## I don't want to get heated...
When many picture debate, it's easy to imagine a bossy courtroom full of people who are shouting, confrontational, and even mean. In practice, this is rarely the case! One cannot be a good debater without the ability to listen to others, to be curious about people different from you, and to have an open mind willing to understand new perspectives. This is especially the case, as you do not get to choose the side you debate in a round.

Batey knows intimately how scary public speaking can be, how much courage it takes to put one's self out there, and the potential for anxiety (and fun!) a debate can create. The people in our club take great responsibility in making sure everyone is comfortable and enjoying playing, what is essentially a game. We take these skills into the real world not to berate or be forceful, but to be mindful of the power words have on ourselves and each other.

That's not to say there isn't room for heat in debate club! It's not unusual to hear quick quips, funny soundbites, or the occasional trash talk when we really get to know each other. There are plenty of ways for a passionate soul to spit fire, and even thrive in a place like ours - but first and foremost comes everyone's safety and well-being. That's a Batey promise.

## I'm not sure I'll fit in...

From Batey's experience, the people actually attracted to debate tend to be... a bunch of nerds! People who are quirky, funny, a little bit crazy, incredibly diverse, with heads full of ideas they want to share with the world. 

They come to the club seeking things like knowledge, speaking confidence, structure for their jumbled thoughts, or even just a place to belong and feel heard - things our club is happy to help provide. They're some of the most interesting people you'll ever meet, with some of the biggest hearts you'll ever see. Even if you're not so interested in debate, Batey strongly suggests checking out the club for its community - ~~we don't bite probablyyy~~[^1]

If you've read this far, you might be the type of person we're describing. We'd love to meet you!

## I don't want to sound stupid in front of other people.

I'm not sure if this helps or not, but this is a problem people face even when they've debated for many years. But it's okay, because that doesn't stop us from trying and having fun! And everyone's free to just listen in, and come and go as they please in the session.

Also - you won't sound stupid! Especially when we welcome people of all skill levels. We've been there before. And nobody can know everything - losing is a part of the game. And it's fun listening to other smart people talking about things, to learn for next time.

And even if you don't like the way you speak - you sure won't feel like that for long! We've got lessons and drills and personalized feedback from experienced members to help you train your speaking and thinking skills at your own pace - all for free! It's honestly a really sweet deal.

## It sounds kind of cool, but I'm too lazy...

You know what? that's fair lol. But we can't help you there! Some people want something fun to do after class. It's true that you need a lot of work to become super good at debate, but you don't have to do that to be part of our club, or enjoy debating itself, or reap the rewards of the community. 

Getting better at debate is great! It brings structure. It's addicting. People like the grind. You'll feel yourself improving and becoming smarter and funnier. You get to actually use the information you learn in school instead of memorizing for the test. Batey has probably learned more for the sake of debate than all uni classes put together.

## Okay okay, you got me! How can I participate if I'm interested?

Debate Club is a uniquely active club in that we meet multiple times a week - usually once on Tuesday, and once on Wednesday. Come drop by and say hello! We have events like collaborations with Film Club, we go to tournaments, and have our Debate Showdown once a term, open for all skill levels! We also have a Discord where anybody can message or chat, and an Instagram where there are mini-activities and prizes.
 
[^1]: There are surprisingly many instances of our club members dating??? If that's a selling point???
