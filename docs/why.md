# Why Debate?
Batey loves debate! It is an incredibly rewarding activity, in that debate gives back the effort you choose to share with it. Consider trying debate if you:

<li>Want to make new friends</li>
<li>Love learning new things about the world</li>
<li>Enjoy listening to video essays, comedy, and interesting ideas</li>
<li>Have a competitive streak!</li>
<li>Want to feel seen or heard</li>
<li>Crave self improvement / the grind</li>
<li>Want to (sometimes) fly abroad to tournaments for free!!!</li>

## I don't want to get heated...
When many picture debate, it's easy to imagine a bossy courtroom full of people who are shouting, confrontational, and even mean. In practice, this is rarely the case! One cannot be a good debater without the ability to listen to others, to be curious about people different from you, and to have an open mind willing to understand new perspectives. This is especially the case, as you do not get to choose the side you debate in a round.

Batey knows intimately how scary public speaking can be, how much courage it takes to put one's self out there, and the potential for anxiety (and fun!) a debate can create. The people in our club take great responsibility in making sure everyone is comfortable and enjoying playing, what is essentially a game. We take these skills into the real world not to berate or be forceful, but to be mindful of the power words have on ourselves and each other.

That's not to say there isn't room for heat in debate club! It's not unusual to hear quick quips, funny soundbites, or the occasional trash talk when we really get to know each other. There are plenty of ways for a passionate soul to spit fire, and even thrive in a place like ours - but first and foremost comes everyone's safety and well-being. That's a Batey promise.

## I'm not sure I'll fit in...

From Batey's experience, the people actually attracted to debate tend to be... a bunch of nerds! People who are quirky, funny, a little bit crazy, incredibly diverse, with heads full of ideas they want to share with the world. 

They come to the club seeking things like knowledge, speaking confidence, structure for their jumbled thoughts, or even just a place to belong and feel heard - things our club is happy to help provide. They're some of the most interesting people you'll ever meet, with some of the biggest hearts you'll ever see. Even if you're not so interested in debate, Batey strongly suggests checking out the club for its community - ~~we don't bite probably~~![^1]

If you're reading this and you feel like you might be one of us,

## I don't want to sound stupid in front of other people.

## It sounds kind of cool, but I'm too lazy xdddd

## Okay okay, you got me! How can I participate if I'm interested?

[^1]: There are surprisingly many instances of our club members dating??? If that's a selling point???
