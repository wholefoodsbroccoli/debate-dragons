# Why Debate?
Debate is an incredibly rewarding activity, in that it gives back the effort you share with it. Consider debate if you:

<li>Want to make new friends</li>
<li>Love learning new things about the world</li>
<li>Enjoy listening to video essays, comedy, and interesting ideas</li>
<li>Have a competitive streak!</li>
<li>Want to feel seen or heard</li>
<li>Crave self improvement / the grind</li>
<li>Want to (sometimes) fly abroad to tournaments for free!!!</li>

## The Community
When people picture debate, it's easy to imagine a bossy courtroom full of people who are shouting, confrontational, and even mean. In practice, this is rarely the case! One cannot be a good debater without the ability to listen to others, to be curious about people different from you, and to have an open mind willing to understand new perspectives.

Debaters know intimately how scary public speaking can be, how much courage it takes to put one's self out there, and the potential for anxiety (and fun!) a debate can cause. The people in our club take great responsibility in making sure everyone is comfortable and having fun playing, what is essentially a game. 

In Batey's experience, the people actually attracted to debate tend to be... a bunch of nerds! People who are quirky, funny, a little bit crazy, incredibly diverse, and have tons of ideas they can share with the world. Even if they don't yet have the confidence or structure to deliver them the way they'd like. 

They are some of the most interesting people with the biggest hearts you'll meet. If you're reading this and you feel like you might be one of us, I strongly suggest
