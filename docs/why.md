# Why Debate?
Debate is an incredibly rewarding activity, in that it gives back the effort you share with it. Consider debate if you:

-Want to make new friends
-Love learning new things about the world
-Enjoy listening to video essays, and other interesting ideas
-Have a competitive streak!
-Want to be heard
-Crave self improvement / the grind
-Want to (sometimes) fly abroad to tournaments for free!!!
